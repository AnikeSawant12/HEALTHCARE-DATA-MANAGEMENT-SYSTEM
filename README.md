# Healthcare Data Management System

## Project Overview
This project involves designing and implementing a high-performance relational database for managing healthcare data. The system processes 100K+ healthcare records and supports ETL workflows to handle 1K+ new records daily. Key operations such as incremental data loading, referential integrity, and complex data queries have been automated using SQL Server, Stored Procedures, Views, and Partitioning.

## Features
- Data Modeling: Designed a normalized relational database for healthcare records.
- ETL Workflow: Developed ETL pipelines to process daily incremental data, ensuring data integration and accuracy.
- SQL Queries: Implemented complex queries using joins, CTEs, and window functions to analyze healthcare trends.
- Automation: Automated operations through stored procedures and triggers for primary key assignment and referential integrity.
- Performance Optimization: Utilized indexing and partitioning to enhance query performance and reduce execution time.

## Technologies Used
- SQL Server
- Stored Procedures
- Views
- Partitioning
- ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
- Indexing & Query Optimization

## Project Goals
- Optimize query performance for large datasets.
- Automate and simplify healthcare data operations.
- Provide insightful reports on healthcare trends and HCP distributions.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up the SQL Server environment.
3. Run the ETL scripts to load sample data into the database.
4. Use the SQL queries to retrieve insights and reports.
